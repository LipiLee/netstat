# netstat
netstat command with process names in Android adb shell

If the uid is 0 or 1000, its process name will be 'system'
and shared uid has many process names.

I have changed toolbox's netstat in Android source code
(~~https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/toolbox/netstat.c~~)
(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/lollipop-release/toolbox/netstat.c).

UPDATE: The netstat in toolbox was removed in Android 6.0(Marshmallow).
And new netstat of [toybox](https://github.com/landley/toybox)
in [Android Marshmallow(6.0)](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/toybox/)
is added and needs root priviledge to get PID or Process name, *NOT this netstat*.

## Example
![example](sample.png)

## Installation
You can use netstat3 binary for ARM CPU.
And it can be installed to runnable directory
without root priviledge in Android device.
```bash
$> adb push netstat3 /data/local/tmp
```

## Configuration
It should be executable using chmod command.
```bash
$> adb shell
shell@xxx:/ $ chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/netstat3
```

## Run
This netstat don't need the root priviledge to run.
```bash
shell@xxx:/ $ /data/local/tmp/netstat3
```
